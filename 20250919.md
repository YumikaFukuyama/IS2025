### ⁉ Five Engaging Questions for Information Systems
**1. Think about the last app you used on your phone. 📱 What are its core hardware, software, and data components? What problem does it solve for you? 🤔💡⚙️**
    Hint: 從你常用的手機應用程式，思考它的組成要素與目的。
*Core Hardware Components:*
1. Processor (CPU/GPU): Your phone’s processor handles the heavy lifting—whether it's rendering images, videos, or loading the feed. Instagram, being image and video-heavy, benefits from strong graphical performance (GPU) too.
2. Storage (RAM/Storage memory): Instagram stores images, videos, cache data, and other resources temporarily in RAM for fast access. Additionally, your phone's internal storage holds your profile data and offline media.
3. Camera: The camera is essential for posting photos and videos, especially since Instagram is centered around visual content.
4. Network Hardware (Wi-Fi/Cellular): Instagram is data-intensive, so a good network connection (Wi-Fi or cellular) is key for uploading content, streaming stories, and browsing feeds smoothly.
*Core Software Components:*
1. Operating System (iOS/Android): Instagram is built on top of the iOS or Android operating system, which handles the basic functions (like touch input, notifications, power management, etc.).
2. Instagram App Code: The core functionality of Instagram—such as browsing the feed, liking posts, commenting, uploading content, and using stories—is powered by the app's internal code (written in languages like Swift, Java, or React Native).
3. Cloud Infrastructure/Backend Services: Instagram relies heavily on cloud services (Amazon Web Services, for example) to store media, deliver content, and manage user accounts. All of the data is fetched, processed, and served from Instagram’s backend servers.
4. Content Delivery Network (CDN): This ensures images and videos load quickly by distributing copies of content across servers in different geographic locations.
*Core Data Components:*
1. User Data: Instagram stores information about your profile (username, bio, profile picture, posts, followers/following, etc.). Your interactions (likes, comments, DMs) also contribute to your user data.
2. Media (Photos & Videos): This is the primary data on Instagram. Every image and video you post is stored and retrieved from the server.
3. Analytics Data: Instagram collects data on how you interact with the app (scrolling behavior, engagement with specific posts) to personalize your feed and ads.
4. Social Graph: This is a complex data structure that represents the relationships between users—who you follow, who follows you, who interacts with whom, etc.

**2. Imagine you have to create a new information system for your favorite coffee shop. ☕️ How would it help the staff with their processes? Who are the key people who would use it? 👨‍🍳👩‍💻📈🤝**

*Key Features of the Information System:*
*Order Management:*
- Customer Ordering System: A point-of-sale (POS) system or a mobile app where customers can place their orders (either in-person or for pickup/delivery). This would allow the customer to customize their drinks, specify sizes, and choose add-ons (like syrups or milk alternatives).

- Order Queue: Once an order is placed, it appears on the kitchen display screen (or tablet) for baristas. They can prioritize based on the type of drink (e.g., a latte vs. a cold brew), and mark when it's completed.
*Key People Who Would Use the System:*
1. Baristas & Kitchen Staff
2. Store Managers & Supervisors
3. Cashiers & Front-line Staff
4. Customers (Indirect Users)

*How This Information System Helps Staff:*
-Efficiency Boost: Automating order entry and payment processing means staff don’t have to worry about manual tasks, leaving them more time to focus on customer service and drink preparation.
-Reduced Errors: Real-time tracking of orders and inventory reduces the chance of mistakes (e.g., giving the wrong order to a customer or running out of key ingredients).
-Better Communication: The system streamlines communication between the front of house (cashiers) and the back of house (baristas, kitchen staff). Everyone can see the current orders and priorities, reducing confusion.
-Data Insights: Managers can make informed decisions based on sales trends, customer preferences, and employee performance data.
-Enhanced Customer Experience: By improving speed, accuracy, and personalization, the system helps create a better customer experience, leading to happier customers and potentially more business.

**3. The material says IS helps organizations gain a competitive advantage. 🏆 Can you think of a company that uses an IS so well it seems like their secret weapon? 🤫 What makes their system so special? 🚀✨🌟**
    Hint: 舉一個你認為因資訊系統而特別成功的公司，並說明它的獨特之處。
Why Amazon's IS is Special:
1. Data-Driven Personalization

Amazon’s IS uses massive amounts of customer data to personalize shopping experiences. It tracks every interaction you make—what you browse, what you add to your cart, what you buy, and even how long you linger on a particular product page.
2. Supply Chain & Inventory Management:

Amazon’s supply chain management is legendary, and it’s largely driven by its IS. The company uses real-time inventory management to track products across hundreds of fulfillment centers worldwide, making sure that they can fulfill orders in the most efficient way possible.
3. Amazon Web Services (AWS):

This is another part of Amazon’s IS that gives it a massive edge over competitors. AWS is the largest cloud computing platform in the world, and it’s not just for Amazon itself—it’s the backbone of many other companies, from startups to large enterprises.
4. Automated Warehouses & Logistics:

Amazon has revolutionized the logistics industry by using its IS to power robotics and automated warehouses. These systems help reduce the time it takes to pick, pack, and ship products.
5. Seamless Integration of Multiple Services:

Amazon’s IS integrates all of its services under one platform. From e-commerce to AWS to Prime Video, Amazon has built an ecosystem that’s tightly connected. When you’re a Prime member, you get free delivery, access to exclusive video content, music streaming, and more—all powered by a unified system.

**4. You're the "people" component of an IS. 🙋‍♂️ A new system is being implemented at your workplace, and it's making your job harder, not easier. 😫 What would you do? How would you communicate your concerns? 🗣️📝💬**
    Hint: 如果新系統讓你工作更難，你會怎麼反應和溝通？
1. Reflect on the Specific Issues:

Before raising concerns, it’s important to pinpoint exactly what aspects of the new system are causing difficulties. Are there specific tasks that are more time-consuming now? Is the interface confusing? Are there more steps involved in what used to be a simple process?
2. Gather Evidence:

I would make sure to gather concrete examples of how the system is affecting my workflow.
3. Formulate Solutions, Not Just Problems:

When communicating concerns, it’s more productive to focus not just on what's wrong but also on potential solutions. I’d think about what aspects of the system could be adjusted or improved to make things more efficient for everyone.
4. Communicate My Concerns:
*Approaching Management or the IT Team:*
-Be Specific and Objective: When communicating with my manager or the IT team, I would be clear, specific, and objective. I’d say something like:
 - “I’ve noticed that the new system is causing some delays in [specific task]. For example, it’s taking me twice as long to [task], and I’ve observed that [specific problem] is making it difficult to [outcome].”
 - “Here are a few ways I think we could improve the process: [solutions].”

- Use Data & Evidence: I’d back up my concerns with specific examples. If I’m able to show that the system is slowing me down (e.g., data entry that used to take 10 minutes now takes 20, or frequent crashes), it makes the issue more tangible.

- Frame It Positively: Instead of saying "This system is terrible and making my job impossible," I could frame the feedback in a way that aligns with the goals of the company, such as:

 - "I want to make sure I’m working as efficiently as possible, and I think there are a few tweaks we could make to the system to speed up the workflow."

-Provide Feedback on User Experience: If the system feels unintuitive or complex, I might provide feedback on specific pain points, like:

 - “It seems like the [feature] could be more streamlined. Right now, I need to click through multiple screens to accomplish a simple task. Could we explore a quicker way to access this information?”

*Team Collaboration:*
If I’m part of a team that’s also struggling, I might organize a meeting to discuss our shared issues. This would allow us to present our feedback collectively, which can be more impactful. For example:

- “Several of us have been finding it difficult to [task] with the new system. We think some adjustments to [specific features] could help us work more effectively. Could we set up a time to discuss this with IT or the vendor?”

5. Be Open to Feedback and Changes:

I’d need to be ready to listen to the reasons behind the system’s design and understand any constraints. Maybe there’s a reason the system works the way it does (e.g., for security or compliance), or maybe there are plans to roll out updates that will address my concerns in the near future.

It’s important to stay open to compromise or adjustments, and to maintain a collaborative approach.

6. Propose Ongoing Evaluation:

Sometimes systems need time to adjust to, so I’d propose a feedback loop with regular check-ins to assess how the system is working in practice and whether changes are improving the experience. For example:

 - “Can we schedule a follow-up meeting in a month to assess if the updates or fixes we’ve discussed have helped improve efficiency?”
    
**5. What's one everyday problem you have that could be solved by a simple IS? 🤔 For example, managing your daily schedule or tracking your expenses. 🗓️ How would your proposed system work? 💡✍️📊**
    Hint: 找出一個生活中的小問題，並發想如何用一個簡單的資訊系統解決它。
    
✅ Everyday Problem: Staying on Top of Daily Tasks and Appointments
- Most people juggle work tasks, personal to-dos, appointments, deadlines, and random errands — and it's easy to forget or miss something. Sticky notes, reminders, and calendar apps help, but often they’re scattered and don’t work together well.

💡 Proposed Simple Information System: "Smart Day Hub"
- A unified Task + Schedule + Habit Tracker IS designed for realistic daily planning. Think of it like your personal command center for the day.

🔧 How the System Would Work:
🧠 1. Input Layer (User Data Entry):
You input tasks, appointments, deadlines, and habits you’re tracking (e.g., drink water, stretch, read).
You can speak them ("Remind me to email Sarah at 3pm") or type them.
Option to sync with your phone calendar or email (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).

🗓️ 2. Processing Layer (Smart Organizer):
Prioritizes tasks using deadlines, urgency, estimated time, and location (if needed).
Creates a realistic schedule by spreading tasks through your available day—like a flexible, auto-generated daily plan.
Reschedules missed tasks automatically to the next best slot.

📊 3. Output Layer (User Interface):
Clean daily dashboard with:

🕒 A timeline view (like a calendar)
✅ Task list (check-off style)
🔁 Habit tracker (with progress circles)
📈 End-of-day summary (what you did, what’s left, habit streaks)

🔔 4. Notification System:
Sends reminders just before tasks or events.
Gentle nudges: “You’ve been working for 45 minutes. Time for a break?” or “Did you finish your report? It’s still marked incomplete.”

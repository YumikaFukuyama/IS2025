### Mission 1: Analyze, Read, and Learn from Studio for the 8 Key Features then Update to Your GitHub Page with your Key Takeways & Applications about “VPN? and How Does It Work?” for 8 key outcomes?
#### VPN: How It Works — 8 Key Outcomes

1. **VPN definition:** Encrypted tunnel to a VPN server; not full anonymity.
2. **Protection on the path:** Encrypts traffic against local network sniffing (public Wi-Fi).
3. **IP masking:** Sites see VPN server IP; reduces basic tracking.
4. **Protocol selection:** WireGuard/OpenVPN/IKEv2 trade speed vs compatibility vs stability.
5. **Leak prevention:** DNS leaks can expose visited domains; use leak protection.
6. **Kill switch:** Stops traffic if VPN drops to prevent real IP exposure.
7. **Split tunneling:** Useful for performance + local access, but can cause accidental leaks.
8. **Trust shift:** ISP sees less; VPN provider becomes a new trust point—choose wisely.

**My applications:** public Wi-Fi safety, remote access, reducing IP exposure, and learning network security basics (DNS, protocols, routing).

### Mission 2: Please analyze and create your own 8 key outcomes by your story (e.g., Midterm Prsentation, YouTube Video about Information System)

**Option A: Midterm Presentation Story — 8 Key Outcomes**

1.Problem framing: I learned to define the real problem (pain points + stakeholders) before proposing solutions.
2.System thinking: I mapped inputs → processes → outputs → feedback loops instead of listing features.
3.Data mindset: I clarified what data is needed, where it comes from, and how quality affects decisions.

Security awareness: I added privacy + access control as requirements (not last-minute add-ons).

Feasibility check: I compared “ideal design” vs real constraints (time, budget, tools, skills).

User-first design: I created user journeys and prioritized usability to reduce friction.

Clear communication: I improved explaining complex ideas with simple diagrams + one-message-per-slide.

Reflection & iteration: I used feedback to revise quickly—prototype → test → improve.

Option B: YouTube Video (Information Systems) Story — 8 Key Outcomes

Hook matters: I learned to start with a relatable scenario before definitions.

Explain with examples: I connected concepts (VPN/DNS/authentication) to real daily apps.

Accuracy over hype: I avoided “VPN = total anonymity” myths and explained limits.

Structure: I used a repeatable flow: concept → how it works → risks → best practices.

Visual clarity: I used simple network diagrams (device → VPN server → website).

Practical tips: I included actionable settings (kill switch, DNS leak protection).

Ethics & compliance: I acknowledged legal/school policy boundaries and responsible use.

Audience feedback: I learned to refine pacing and clarity based on comments/questions.

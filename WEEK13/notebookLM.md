### Language Setting: English 
The sources provide extensive detail on the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decisions regarding monetary policy, reserve management, and the current economic outlook as of December 10, 2025.
Here is a detailed breakdown of the key areas discussed:
**I. Monetary Policy Decisions and Rationale**
The Rate Cut Decision
The FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, setting the new range at 3 1/2% to 3 3/4%. This decision aligns with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and stable prices. This was the third rate reduction in the last three meetings, bringing the total reduction to 3/4 of a percentage point.
Shift in the Balance of Risks
The primary justification for the rate cut was a shift in the balance of risks. While inflation remains somewhat elevated relative to the 2% long-run goal, the downside risks to employment have risen in recent months. This creates a "challenging situation" and requires a balanced approach to promoting both sides of the dual mandate.
Policy Stance and Neutrality
The adjustments made to the policy stance since September place the federal funds rate within a range of plausible estimates of its neutral value. This means the policy is no longer considered strongly restrictive. The Committee now believes it is "well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves" and determine the extent and timing of any additional adjustments based on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. A rate hike is not currently viewed as the base case for the next move.
**II. Economic and Inflation Outlook**
Economic Activity and Projections
Economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace, supported by solid consumer spending and continued expansion in business fixed investment. Activity in the housing sector, however, remains weak.
The median participant in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projects that real GDP will rise 1.7% this year and 2.3% next year, which is slightly stronger than projections made in September. This more optimistic outlook is driven primarily by resilient consumer spending and AI spending on data centers and related business investment.
**Labor Market Softening**
The labor market appears to be gradually cooling. Official employment data for October and November are delayed, but available evidence suggests both layoffs and hiring remain low. The official September report showed the unemployment rate edging up to 4.4%.
The Chair noted that official payroll job numbers might contain a systematic overcount (estimated at about 60,000 per month), meaning that the actual job creation rate since April could potentially be negative (-20,000 per month). The median SEP projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5% by the end of this year. The lack of a major decline in unemployment despite higher growth projections suggests the implication of higher productivity, potentially fueled by AI and structurally higher productivity rates (around 2% per year).
**Inflation Dynamics**
Inflation remains "somewhat elevated". Total and core PCE prices rose 2.8% over the 12 months ending in September.
The sources emphasize that the inflation overshoot is primarily driven by:
1. Goods Inflation due to Tariffs: Goods inflation has picked up, reflecting the effects of tariffs.
2. Services Disinflation: Disinflation appears to be continuing for services.
The FOMC views tariff effects as a "one-time shift in the price level," which should be relatively short-lived. If there are no major new tariff announcements, goods inflation is expected to peak around the first quarter of next year. The mandate is to ensure that this one-time price increase does not evolve into an ongoing inflation problem.
**III. Policy Implementation and Reserve Management**
**Reserve Management Purchases**
Separate from the monetary policy stance, the Committee decided to initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities (mainly T-bills). This operational move is solely for the purpose of maintaining an ample supply of reserves over time, thus supporting effective control of the policy rate.
This action was deemed necessary because reserve balances had declined to "ample levels," evidenced by the tightening of money market interest rates. The economy’s growth leads to rising demand for the Fed’s liabilities, including currency and reserves.
**Details of Purchases**
Purchases will amount to $40 billion in the first month and may remain elevated for a few months. This is partly a temporary "front loading" to ensure sufficient reserves are available through the mid-April tax period, when reserves temporarily drop sharply.
**Use of Standing Repo Operations**
In the current ample reserves regime, the Committee eliminated the aggregate limit on standing repurchase agreement (repo) operations. These are considered a critical tool to ensure the federal funds rate remains within its target range, especially during periods of elevated pressure in money markets.

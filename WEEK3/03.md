#### ‚ùå **Cons of Using AI:**

1. **Lack of Human Insight**  
   - AI systems may miss subtle factors like interpersonal skills, creativity, and team dynamics, which are important for a full evaluation.

2. **Over-Reliance on Data**  
   - Performance data can be limited or misinterpreted, especially in jobs where success is not easily measurable. This could lead to inaccurate evaluations.

3. **Employee Trust Issues**  
   - Employees might feel uncomfortable knowing that an AI is assessing their performance, potentially leading to a lack of trust in the evaluation process.

4. **Bias in Data**  
   - AI systems are only as good as the data they‚Äôre trained on. If the data used to train the AI has biases, it can reinforce them, leading to unfair assessments.

* Part 6: Content Drafting & Solution Design

#### üìö 5 Important Prompt Engineering Principles and New Examples

1. **Clarity and Specificity**  
   - **Principle:** Be clear and specific in your prompts to get accurate and relevant responses.
   - **Example:**  
     - *Bad Prompt:* "Tell me about dogs."  
     - *Good Prompt:* "What are the main differences between a Labrador Retriever and a Golden Retriever in terms of temperament?"

2. **Contextual Relevance**

   - **Example:**  
     - *Bad Prompt:* "What should I do?"  
     - *Good Prompt:* "What are some effective study techniques for a university student preparing for finals?"

3. **Open-ended vs. Closed-ended Prompts**  
   - **Principle:** Choose between open-ended or closed-ended prompts based on the desired response type (broad explanation vs. specific answer).
   - **Example:**  
     - *Open-ended:* "How can AI impact healthcare?"  
     - *Closed-ended:* "Is AI already being used in cancer treatment?"

4. **Prompt Iteration**  
   - **Principle:** If the initial response isn‚Äôt quite right, refine the prompt to gather more specific or correct information.
   - **Example:**  
     - *First Prompt:* "Tell me about renewable energy."  
     - *Refined Prompt:* "What are the key challenges facing solar power adoption in urban areas?"

5. **Avoid Ambiguity**  
   - **Principle:** Avoid vague or ambiguous language to ensure the AI understands exactly what you‚Äôre asking.
   - **Example:**  
     - *Ambiguous Prompt:* "What‚Äôs the best thing to eat?"  
     - *Clear Prompt:* "What‚Äôs the healthiest breakfast option for someone with a gluten allergy?"

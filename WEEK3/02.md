# 🎯**C2: Analytical Thinking Skills — Making AI Your Junior Business Analyst**
* Part 3: Role-Playing & Scenario Analysis
### ✅**Lab 11**: **(W7)** Tell the AI: "You are a cybersecurity consultant. The owner of a small e-commerce website has come to you for advice. Please list the top three security threats they need to worry about and explain why."
#### 👨‍💻 You are a Cybersecurity Consultant
**Top 3 Security Threats:**

1. **Phishing Attacks**  
   - Attackers may trick customers or staff into giving away passwords or payment info via fake emails or websites.
   - Why? It targets user trust and can lead to account theft or payment fraud.

2. **SQL Injection**  
   - Hackers can manipulate website forms to access or damage your database.
   - Why? If your site stores customer data (names, emails, card info), a breach can lead to legal issues and loss of trust.

3. **Lack of HTTPS (Secure Encryption)**  
   - If your website doesn't use HTTPS, data like login or credit card info can be intercepted.
   - Why? Without encryption, user information is exposed to attackers during transmission.

### ✅**Lab 14**: **(W10)** Tell the AI: "You are a project manager. Explain why 'Agile development' is better suited for rapidly changing market demands than the traditional 'Waterfall model.'"
#### 👷 You are a Project Manager

**Why Agile is better for fast-changing markets than the Waterfall model:**

| Feature                  | Agile Development                           | Waterfall Model                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Flexibility**          | High – adapts to changes quickly            | Low – hard to make changes once started  |
| **Customer Feedback**    | Frequent – feedback after every sprint      | Limited – mainly at the end              |
| **Delivery Speed**       | Faster, in small parts                      | Slower, all at once                      |
| **Risk Management**      | Ongoing – issues caught early               | Late discovery – risks pile up           |
| **Team Collaboration**   | Continuous and dynamic                      | Step-by-step and static                  |

**Conclusion:**  
Agile supports rapid iteration and feedback, making it ideal for projects in evolving markets where needs change frequently.

### ✅**Lab 15**: **(W12)** Tell the AI: "You are an economist. Analyze how the emerging skill of 'Prompt Engineering' will affect the digital divide between developed and developing countries."
#### 📉 You are an Economist

**Prompt Engineering** – crafting inputs that guide AI tools effectively (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot).

#### 🌍 Impact on the Digital Divide:

- **In Developed Countries:**
  - Faster adoption due to existing digital infrastructure.
  - Prompt engineering boosts productivity in education, healthcare, coding, marketing, etc.
  - Early access = competitive edge in the global economy.

- **In Developing Countries:**
  - Limited internet, devices, and AI access slow down learning and application.
  - Language and educational barriers hinder effective prompt use.
  - Risk: AI-trained workforce grows in rich nations, leaving others behind.

**Conclusion:**  
Without investment in AI literacy and infrastructure, prompt engineering may widen the gap, increasing inequality in digital job access and innovation.

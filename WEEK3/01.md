## üöÄC1: Foundational Prompting Skills ‚Äî Making AI Your 24/7 Personal Tutor
* Part 1: Concept Clarification
- ‚≠ê**Lab 1**: **(W2)** Tell the AI: "Explain 'what is an information system' in a way that a **5-year-old kid** can understand."
> For a 5-year-old:
An information system is like a big toy box. Inside it, there are toys (that's the information).
You have your hands (that's the people who use it) to take toys out and play with them.
There‚Äôs a computer (that‚Äôs the hardware), and sometimes you need to follow rules to play with the toys (that‚Äôs the software).

> For a 30-year-old:
An information system is a combination of people, hardware, software, and data that work together to process information and support decision-making.
Think of it as a tool used in businesses to collect, store, and analyze data for informed actions.

- ‚≠ê**Lab 2**: **(W2)** Tell the AI: "Using a **restaurant** as an example, explain the five components of an information system: hardware, software, data, people, and processes."
> For a 5-year-old:
In a restaurant, the food is like the information.
The kitchen is the computer (hardware), the cook is the software that makes the food, the waiter is the person who helps, and the menu is the list of things you can choose (data).
The rules about when to serve food are the process.

> For a 30-year-old:
In a restaurant, the hardware is the physical tools like ovens and computers. 
The software is the systems the restaurant uses to manage orders. 
The data is things like the menu items and orders. People include customers, waiters, and cooks, while processes are the steps taken to prepare and deliver food, ensuring smooth operation.

- ‚≠ê**Lab 3**: **(W3)** Tell the AI: "Explain 'Moore's Law' and provide **a real-world product example** from the last 20 years that demonstrates it."
> For a 5-year-old:
Moore‚Äôs Law is like a magic rule that makes computers get faster and better every year, just like how your toys might change and get cooler over time.
A good example is your iPad or phone getting better each year!

> For a 30-year-old:
Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles about every two years, making computers faster and more powerful. 
A real-world example is the iPhone: over the last 20 years, its processing speed, camera quality, and battery life have dramatically improved due to advancements in chip technology.
  
- ‚≠ê**Lab 4**: **(W4)** Tell the AI: "What is the difference between an operating system and application software? Please use the analogy of a house's foundation and its furniture."
> For a 5-year-old:
Think of a house. The foundation (operating system) is the strong base that holds the whole house up.
The furniture (application software) is the stuff you put inside the house to make it fun, like your toys or bed.

> For a 30-year-old:
An operating system is like the foundation of a house‚Äîit's essential for everything to function, providing the basic support and structure for running applications.
Application software, like your favorite apps, is like the furniture inside the house. It's what you use to do specific tasks, but without the foundation (the OS), the house wouldn‚Äôt stand.

- ‚≠ê**Lab 5**: **(W5)** Tell the AI: "What is the difference between Data, Information, and Knowledge? Please use the example of a daily weather forecast to illustrate the transformation relationship between the three."
> For a 5-year-old:
Imagine you see numbers about the weather‚Äîthose are like data.
When you know the weather will be sunny or rainy, that‚Äôs information.
And when you know what to wear based on the weather, like a raincoat if it‚Äôs rainy, that‚Äôs knowledge.

> For a 30-year-old:
Data is raw facts like the temperature (e.g., 70¬∞F), without context. 
Information is when you understand those facts (e.g., it‚Äôs a warm day). 
Knowledge is using that information to make decisions, like wearing a light jacket because it‚Äôs warm but not hot. 
It's the transformation from raw numbers to actionable insight.

* Part 2: Compare & Contrast
> ‚≠ê**Lab 6**: **(W3)** Tell the AI: "Please use a table to compare five main differences between a Personal Computer (PC) and an Enterprise Server."

### 📌 Mission 1: Opening Move ("起手式") - “What Is Computer Hardware in Your Daily Life?”, Please think and create a GitHub page (e.g., “hardware.md”, and try to answer the question in 200 words plus one photo?
<img width="667" height="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/375f2c11-c9e7-4314-9f49-76b70d3df0cc" />
**Opening Move 起手式 — What Is Computer Hardware in Your Daily Life?**
In our daily life, computer hardware is all around us — often in ways we don’t even notice. Hardware means the **physical devices** that let us interact with digital systems. From the moment you wake up, hardware is at work: your phone’s touchscreen, your laptop, the Wi-Fi router, even smart home gadgets like a smart light bulb or thermostat all include computer hardware inside.

When you type on a keyboard or tap on your phone, you’re using input hardware. When you view a photo, video, or read messages, you’re seeing output hardware (like displays, speakers). Inside, there are critical hardware components you don’t see:  
- **CPU / Processor**: the “brain” that runs instructions  
- **Memory (RAM)**: short-term workspace while your device runs apps  
- **Storage (SSD / HDD / flash memory)**: where data is kept long term  
- **Motherboard, power supply, circuits**: make everything work together properly  

Hardware works in tandem with software (apps, operating systems) to make tasks possible — like writing an email, streaming music, or video calling. Without the hardware, the software has nowhere to run; without the software, the hardware is just inert parts.  

So next time you unlock your phone, plug in a USB drive, or speak to a smart speaker — remember: those are all examples of computer hardware in your life.

### What Is Hardware?
Hardware is the physical parts of a computer — the things you can see and touch.

Examples of hardware:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Monitor (screen)
- CPU (processor)
- RAM (memory)
- Hard drive / SSD
- Printer
Smartphone (yes, that's hardware too!)

👉 Think of hardware as the "body" of a computer.

### What is Software?
Software is the programs and applications that run on the hardware. You can’t touch software — it's digital.

Examples of software:
-Windows, macOS, Linux (Operating Systems)
- Microsoft Word, Excel
- Google Chrome
- Games
- Mobile apps
- Photoshop

👉 Think of software as the "brain" or "instructions" that tell the hardware what to do.

### What Is Bit?
**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is a type of digital currency (also called cryptocurrency) that was invented in 2009 by an unknown person (or group) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

- It allows people to send and receive money over the internet without needing a bank or government.
- It runs on a technology called blockchain, which is like a public, unchangeable digital ledger.

Bitcoin is decentralized — meaning no single person, company, or government controls it.

1. Bit 
A "bit" is a basic unit of digital information in computing. Since Bitcoin is purely digital, this makes sense.

2. Coin 
Like traditional money, a "coin" is a unit of currency. So "coin" represents its use as money.

🔗 So, Bitcoin = Digital Coin made of "bits."

- In computer science, **1 byte = 8 bits**, and bits are the 1s and 0s that make up all digital information.

### 🖥️ Binary System?  Why Should You Need To Know Binary Sytem?
Because computers are built with electronic circuits that have only two states:
- ✅ ON (has electricity) = 1
- ❌ OFF (no electricity) = 0

This is called binary — a system with only two digits: 0 and 1.

### 🔌 Why not use more numbers like humans do (0–9)?
Because computers are made of tiny switches called transistors, and it’s much simpler and more reliable to just check:
- Is the switch ON? → 1
- Is the switch OFF? → 0

### 📌Mission 2: Please look for information and images to introduce Bit, Byte, KB, MB, GB, TB, 1PB, 1ZB then create and summarize the information into your GitHub Page (i.e., “2_HowBig.md”)
<img width="800" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6643d35c-f9be-4cab-b21c-81715205ebca" />

# How Big? — Bit, Byte, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, ZB

#### 1. Bit and Byte  
- **Bit (b)**: the smallest unit of data — 0 or 1  
- **Byte (B)**: 8 bits  

#### 2. Larger Units  
We often measure data in bigger units to make things easier.  
There are two main conventions: binary (powers of 2) and decimal (powers of 10).  

#### 2.1 Binary-based (common in computing)  
- 1 KB = 1,024 B  
- 1 MB = 1,024 KB  
- 1 GB = 1,024 MB  
- 1 TB = 1,024 GB  
- 1 PB = 1,024 TB  
- 1 EB = 1,024 PB  
- 1 ZB = 1,024 EB  

#### 2.2 Decimal / Metric-based (SI)  
- 1 kB = 1,000 B  
- 1 MB = 1,000 kB  
- etc.

#### 3. Table of Units  

| Unit | Symbol | Bytes Equivalent (binary) | Description / scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| bit | b | 1 | basic unit |
| byte | B | 8 bits | basic block |
| kilobyte | KB | 1,024 B | ~10³ bytes |
| megabyte | MB | 1,024 KB | ~10⁶ bytes |
| gigabyte | GB | 1,024 MB | ~10⁹ bytes |
| terabyte | TB | 1,024 GB | ~10¹² bytes |
| petabyte | PB | 1,024 TB | ~10¹⁵ bytes |
| exabyte | EB | 1,024 PB | ~10¹⁸ bytes |
| zettabyte | ZB | 1,024 EB | ~10²¹ bytes |

#### 4. Why It Matters & Common Confusions  
- **Byte vs bit**: uppercase B vs lowercase b — 1 Byte = 8 bits  
- **Decimal vs binary**: drive manufacturers often use decimal (1,000), OS may use binary (1,024), that’s why your “500 GB” drive might show smaller  
- In many standards, new prefixes “kibi‑, mebi‑, gibi‑, tebi‑ …” (KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB …) exist to explicitly denote binary units. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

#### 5. Real-World Shadows  
- A 5-minute MP3 song might be ~5 MB  
- A 4K movie might be tens of GB  
- A large data center might have petabytes (PB) or more  
- Global internet traffic is sometimes measured in **ZB**

# What’s Inside a PC — 3_WhatInsidePC.md

Computers are more than just the case and screen — inside them is a carefully organized set of hardware that works together. Below are key internal components and how they interact.

---

## 🧠 CPU (Central Processing Unit)  
The CPU is the “brain” of the computer. It executes instructions (arithmetic, logic, control) fetched from memory and coordinates other parts. Modern CPUs often include multiple **cores** and **caches** to perform many tasks in parallel.  

---

## 🧩 Motherboard  
The motherboard is the main circuit board. It provides **slots** or **sockets** where the CPU, RAM, and expansion cards connect, and paths (buses) that let data travel between them. Many components like network, USB, and audio are integrated via its chipset. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

---

## 🗄️ RAM (Random Access Memory)  
RAM is the computer’s short‑term, volatile memory. Programs and data currently in use are loaded into RAM because it’s much faster than long-term storage. But when power is lost, its contents disappear. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

---

## 💾 SSD / Storage  
SSD (Solid State Drive) stores data permanently (non‑volatile). Unlike mechanical hard drives, SSDs have no moving parts and are faster. Many modern PCs use **NVMe SSDs** connected via PCIe or **SATA SSDs** via the SATA interface. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

---

## 🔌 USB Drive / External Storage  
A USB drive (flash drive) is portable storage you can plug into a USB port. Internally, USB controllers manage communication between the drive and the PC’s central system. USB ports are one form of I/O (input/output). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

---

## 🌐 Network  
Networking hardware (Ethernet port, Wi-Fi card) allows connection to local networks and the internet. Many motherboards integrate network controllers. Data travels in and out through network I/O. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

---

## 🔄 Input / Output (I/O)  
I/O refers to all ways the computer interacts with the outside world — keyboards, mice, display, audio, USB, etc. On the motherboard, **I/O controllers** or **Super I/O** chips manage lower-speed devices like serial ports, keyboard/mouse, and legacy ports. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

---

### 🔄 How They Work Together (Simplified Flow)

1. The CPU sends a request to memory (RAM) or storage (SSD).  
2. The motherboard’s buses and chipset route signals between CPU, RAM, storage, and I/O devices.  
3. Data from external drives (USB) or network comes via I/O controllers and is processed or stored.  
4. Output (display, audio) is sent back through I/O to external devices.

This gives you the internal “anatomy” of a PC — showing which parts exist inside and how they cooperate. If you like, I can also prepare a diagram + ready-to-push markdown file with nicer styling. Would you like me to send that?  

### 📌Mission 4: Please look for information and images in the speed of CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Hard Disk, SSD, USB Drive, Network, etc then create and summarize the information into your GitHub Page (e.g., “4_HowFast.md”)
<img width="700" height="606" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ddc4dab-fe24-41dd-9a42-2e216a10be4a" />
#### ⚙️ CPU & Latency
A simple instruction or register access happens in ~10 nanoseconds (ns) or less. 

Accessing data in different levels of cache and memory adds latency:
 • L3 cache: ~15–20 ns 
 • DRAM (main memory): ~50–100 ns
 
#### 🧠 RAM (Memory) Speeds
RAM speed is measured in MT/s (mega transfers per second) or MHz. 

A DDR4 module at, say, 3200 MT/s delivers a theoretical bandwidth ≈ 25.6 GB/s (for a 64-bit bus ×2 channels) 
Practical speed is lower, due to overhead, timings, and real‑world conditions.

#### 💾 Storage: Hard Disk vs SSD
HDD (spinning disk) typical speeds: ~ 80–160 MB/s 

SATA SSDs often reach ~ 500–600 MB/s on modern interfaces. 

NVMe SSDs (PCIe interface) are much faster:
 • PCIe Gen3 ×4: up to ~3,000–3,500 MB/s 
 • PCIe Gen4 ×4: ~7,000 MB/s or more in modern devices

### 📌Mission 5: Please look for information and images in Arduino and Raspberry then create and summarize the information into your GitHub Page (e.g., “5_IoT-Device.md”)
<img width="1280" height="833" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc6448e3-d42f-46f3-ba67-c8c3bb9f37ab" />

### 5_IoT‑Device — Arduino & Raspberry Pi in the IoT World

Internet of Things (IoT) devices often use small boards to sense, process, and communicate data. Two of the most popular platforms are **Arduino** and **Raspberry Pi**. Below is a summary of each, plus when to use which.

---

#### 🟢 Arduino

Arduino is an **open‑source microcontroller platform**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- Contains a microcontroller (often AVR, e.g. ATmega328) plus support circuits (clock, regulator, I/O pins). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- No full operating system — it runs a single “sketch” (program) repeatedly.  
- Exposes **GPIO pins**, ADC, PWM, and serial interfaces, allowing direct interaction with sensors, motors, LEDs, etc.  
- Low cost, low power, easy to use, and great for real‑time / embedded control.  
- Many “shields” or expansion modules exist (e.g. WiFi shield, motor drivers) to extend functionality.

**Use Arduino when** you need a simple, real‑time controller to read sensors or drive actuators, with minimal overhead.

---

#### 🍓 Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a **single board computer (SBC)** — essentially a small Linux computer on a board. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- Has a CPU, RAM, GPU, USB ports, network interfaces, HDMI, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Runs a full operating system (often Raspberry Pi OS, a variant of Linux).  
- Supports multitasking, file systems, networking, and high-level languages (Python, C, etc.).  
- Has **GPIO header pins** for interacting with hardware (sensors, displays) like Arduino but within a more powerful computing environment.

**Use Raspberry Pi when** you need more processing power, file storage, networking, or a full OS for complex logic or web services.

---

#### 🔍 Arduino vs Raspberry Pi — Comparison

| Feature | Arduino | Raspberry Pi |
|---|---|---|
| Operating System | None (bare metal) | Full OS (Linux) |
| Processing Power & Memory | Limited | Much higher |
| Power Consumption | Low | Higher |
| Good at | Real-time control, sensor/actuator interface | Web server, data processing, interfacing, multitasking |
| Complexity | Easier for hardware beginners | More versatile but more complex |

---

#### 🛠️ Hybrid Use & Integration

Many IoT projects combine both:

- Use **Arduino** for real-time sensor reading, motor control, or timing-sensitive tasks.  
- Use **Raspberry Pi** for data aggregation, user interface (web dashboard), networking, and heavier computation.  
- They can communicate via serial, I²C, SPI, or network protocols to complement each other.

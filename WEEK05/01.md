# Unit 3 Technical Foundations： Hardware
### 📌 Mission 1: Opening Move ("起手式") - “What Is Computer Hardware in Your Daily Life?”, Please think and create a GitHub page (e.g., “hardware.md”, and try to answer the question in 200 words plus one photo?

**Opening Move 起手式 — What Is Computer Hardware in Your Daily Life?**
In our daily life, computer hardware is all around us — often in ways we don’t even notice. Hardware means the **physical devices** that let us interact with digital systems. From the moment you wake up, hardware is at work: your phone’s touchscreen, your laptop, the Wi-Fi router, even smart home gadgets like a smart light bulb or thermostat all include computer hardware inside.

When you type on a keyboard or tap on your phone, you’re using input hardware. When you view a photo, video, or read messages, you’re seeing output hardware (like displays, speakers). Inside, there are critical hardware components you don’t see:  
- **CPU / Processor**: the “brain” that runs instructions  
- **Memory (RAM)**: short-term workspace while your device runs apps  
- **Storage (SSD / HDD / flash memory)**: where data is kept long term  
- **Motherboard, power supply, circuits**: make everything work together properly  

Hardware works in tandem with software (apps, operating systems) to make tasks possible — like writing an email, streaming music, or video calling. Without the hardware, the software has nowhere to run; without the software, the hardware is just inert parts.  

So next time you unlock your phone, plug in a USB drive, or speak to a smart speaker — remember: those are all examples of computer hardware in your life.




### What Is Hardware?
Hardware is the physical parts of a computer — the things you can see and touch.

Examples of hardware:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Monitor (screen)
- CPU (processor)
- RAM (memory)
- Hard drive / SSD
- Printer
Smartphone (yes, that's hardware too!)

👉 Think of hardware as the "body" of a computer.

### What is Software?
Software is the programs and applications that run on the hardware. You can’t touch software — it's digital.

Examples of software:
-Windows, macOS, Linux (Operating Systems)
- Microsoft Word, Excel
- Google Chrome
- Games
- Mobile apps
- Photoshop

👉 Think of software as the "brain" or "instructions" that tell the hardware what to do.

### What Is Bit?
**What is Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin is a type of digital currency (also called cryptocurrency) that was invented in 2009 by an unknown person (or group) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

- It allows people to send and receive money over the internet without needing a bank or government.
- It runs on a technology called blockchain, which is like a public, unchangeable digital ledger.

Bitcoin is decentralized — meaning no single person, company, or government controls it.

1. Bit 
A "bit" is a basic unit of digital information in computing. Since Bitcoin is purely digital, this makes sense.

2. Coin 
Like traditional money, a "coin" is a unit of currency. So "coin" represents its use as money.

🔗 So, Bitcoin = Digital Coin made of "bits."

- In computer science, **1 byte = 8 bits**, and bits are the 1s and 0s that make up all digital information.

### 🖥️ Binary System?  Why Should You Need To Know Binary Sytem?
Because computers are built with electronic circuits that have only two states:
- ✅ ON (has electricity) = 1
- ❌ OFF (no electricity) = 0

This is called binary — a system with only two digits: 0 and 1.

### 🔌 Why not use more numbers like humans do (0–9)?
Because computers are made of tiny switches called transistors, and it’s much simpler and more reliable to just check:
- Is the switch ON? → 1
- Is the switch OFF? → 0

### 📌Mission 2: Please look for information and images to introduce Bit, Byte, KB, MB, GB, TB, 1PB, 1ZB then create and summarize the information into your GitHub Page (i.e., “2_HowBig.md”)

# How Big? — Bit, Byte, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, ZB

#### 1. Bit and Byte  
- **Bit (b)**: the smallest unit of data — 0 or 1  
- **Byte (B)**: 8 bits  

#### 2. Larger Units  
We often measure data in bigger units to make things easier.  
There are two main conventions: binary (powers of 2) and decimal (powers of 10).  

#### 2.1 Binary-based (common in computing)  
- 1 KB = 1,024 B  
- 1 MB = 1,024 KB  
- 1 GB = 1,024 MB  
- 1 TB = 1,024 GB  
- 1 PB = 1,024 TB  
- 1 EB = 1,024 PB  
- 1 ZB = 1,024 EB  

#### 2.2 Decimal / Metric-based (SI)  
- 1 kB = 1,000 B  
- 1 MB = 1,000 kB  
- etc.

#### 3. Table of Units  

| Unit | Symbol | Bytes Equivalent (binary) | Description / scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| bit | b | 1 | basic unit |
| byte | B | 8 bits | basic block |
| kilobyte | KB | 1,024 B | ~10³ bytes |
| megabyte | MB | 1,024 KB | ~10⁶ bytes |
| gigabyte | GB | 1,024 MB | ~10⁹ bytes |
| terabyte | TB | 1,024 GB | ~10¹² bytes |
| petabyte | PB | 1,024 TB | ~10¹⁵ bytes |
| exabyte | EB | 1,024 PB | ~10¹⁸ bytes |
| zettabyte | ZB | 1,024 EB | ~10²¹ bytes |

#### 4. Why It Matters & Common Confusions  
- **Byte vs bit**: uppercase B vs lowercase b — 1 Byte = 8 bits  
- **Decimal vs binary**: drive manufacturers often use decimal (1,000), OS may use binary (1,024), that’s why your “500 GB” drive might show smaller  
- In many standards, new prefixes “kibi‑, mebi‑, gibi‑, tebi‑ …” (KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB …) exist to explicitly denote binary units. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

#### 5. Real-World Shadows  
- A 5-minute MP3 song might be ~5 MB  
- A 4K movie might be tens of GB  
- A large data center might have petabytes (PB) or more  
- Global internet traffic is sometimes measured in **ZB**

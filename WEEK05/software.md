# 📌 Mission 1: Opening Move ("起手式") - “What Is Software in Your Daily Life?”, Please think and create a GitHub page (e.g., “software.md”, and try to answer the question in 200 words plus one photo?

Software is the invisible choreography behind ordinary moments. When your alarm rings, a clock app schedules a hardware wake signal. Messages you send hop through networking stacks, encrypted by protocols you never see. Navigation apps stitch satellite signals, maps, and graph algorithms to suggest the fastest route—and re-plan when you miss a turn. Photos are enhanced by computational photography that denoises, balances exposure, and classifies scenes. Even paying for coffee triggers tokenization, fraud detection models, and a ledger update.

At home, streaming platforms buffer video with adaptive bitrate algorithms; recommendation systems learn your tastes. Wearables translate sensor noise into sleep and heart-rate insights. In the background, operating systems juggle memory, enforce permissions, and isolate apps so one crash doesn’t sink your day. Cloud services sync notes across devices, while backups quietly protect your files.

“Software in daily life” isn’t just apps—it’s layers: user interfaces for humans, APIs for systems, and infrastructure for reliability. It turns data into decisions, time into reminders, and intent into action. Good software feels like air: essential, everywhere, and almost unnoticed—until it fails. Recognizing it helps us design responsibly, debug thoughtfully, and build tools that respect users, resources, and time.

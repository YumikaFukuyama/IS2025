# 💡Unit 1.2 What Is an Information System (IS)? W2
## A. Your Kickstart Mission
### 1. Data vs. Information in Your Bank App: When you check your banking app, you see your current balance. What is the raw data that had to be collected and processed to generate that single piece of information (your balance)?
**Deposits:**
Raw data includes the amount and source of deposits (e.g., direct deposit, checks, wire transfers).

Date and time of the deposit.

Account details such as the sender’s account number and the receiver’s account number.

**Withdrawals:**
Raw data for any withdrawals includes the amount, merchant or ATM name, and the location (if applicable).

Date and time of the withdrawal.

The method used for withdrawal (e.g., debit card, ACH, wire).

**Transfers:**
For any transfers between accounts, raw data includes transfer amount, sending account, receiving account, and the transaction date.

**Pending Transactions:**
Data on any transactions that have been authorized but are not yet finalized, including pending charges on the account (e.g., a hotel hold or an authorized but unprocessed payment).

**Interest or Fees:**
Raw data from the bank’s algorithms determining your interest rate or fees, including any monthly maintenance fees, overdraft charges, or interest payments on your account.

**Transaction History:**
A list of past transactions (including deposits, withdrawals, fees, and interest) that are used to compute the current balance.

Data on transaction status (approved, pending, etc.).

**Bank’s Data Systems:**
The bank’s internal processing system stores transaction logs, account states, and historical balance information, which all contribute to calculating the final balance.

**Process:**
1. The bank collects all the transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).

2. It filters out pending or unprocessed transactions.

3. It applies any fees, interest calculations, or adjustments.

4. The system aggregates the total of all processed transactions to produce your current balance.

### 2. The 'System' of Online Shopping: Describe your process for buying a textbook online (from search to checkout). Identify one piece of hardware and one piece of software that is essential for this system to function.
**Step 1:** You visit an online bookstore or marketplace (e.g., Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or a specialized textbook site like Chegg).

**Step 2:** You use the website’s search function to look for the textbook by entering the title, author, ISBN, or course code.

**Step 3:** The site presents a list of textbooks that match or closely match your search query, including various editions, formats (hardcover, paperback, eBook), and prices.

**Step 4:** You review the search results and click on the textbook you want to buy.

**Step 5:** You check the book's details, such as edition, condition (new or used), price, shipping options, and availability. You may also check if there are any discounts or additional services like rental options or digital access.

**Step 6:** After confirming the details, you click the "Add to Cart" button. The system updates your virtual shopping cart to reflect the selected textbook.

**Step 7:** You navigate to your shopping cart to review the items you’ve selected. You can change quantities, remove items, or apply any available promo codes.

**Step 8:** Once satisfied with the items in your cart, you click the "Proceed to Checkout" button.

**Step 9:** You are prompted to enter your shipping address, payment details (credit card, PayPal, etc.), and possibly a billing address.

**Step 10:** Some sites may offer login options to save your information for future purchases, or you may be a guest buyer.

**Step 11:** You review all your details one last time, including the book’s price, shipping costs, and estimated delivery date.

**Step 12:** You confirm the purchase, and the system processes the payment.

**Step 13:** You receive an order confirmation screen and/or email with details of your order, estimated delivery, and tracking information.

### 3. 'People' as IS Components: Think about your experience with university registration. Who are the different "People" involved in that system (not just you), and what unique process does each person enable?
**1. The Student (You)**
Unique Process: The student initiates the registration process by searching for available courses, selecting desired classes, and submitting registration requests. They are responsible for ensuring their eligibility (e.g., prerequisites, enrollment limits) and confirming personal information, such as major or academic standing, to avoid errors in the system.

Key Action: Choosing courses, adding them to the schedule, and finalizing the registration.

**2. Academic Advisors**

Unique Process: Academic advisors guide students in course selection to ensure that their academic plan aligns with graduation requirements. They may review the student’s academic history, discuss career goals, and provide advice on course load and sequence. Advisors may also hold "advising holds" that prevent registration until students meet with them.

Key Action: Reviewing academic progress, providing advice on course selection, and lifting advising holds on registration.

**3. Faculty/Department Heads**

Unique Process: Faculty members or department heads may be involved in course creation, scheduling, and ensuring that courses are staffed with qualified instructors. They are responsible for making sure the course offerings align with departmental needs and ensuring that enrollment limits are set appropriately.

Key Action: Determining course offerings, setting course limits, and approving course content and instructors.

**4. Registrar’s Office**

Unique Process: The registrar’s office oversees the entire registration process, including scheduling courses, processing student registrations, and ensuring that students’ records (like grades, transcripts, and course loads) are up to date. They are responsible for finalizing the registration once courses are selected and ensuring compliance with academic policies.

Key Action: Maintaining and updating student records, overseeing the registration process, ensuring course schedules are published, and managing waitlists.

**5. IT Support Team**

Unique Process: The IT team ensures that the registration platform (often a web-based portal) runs smoothly, is secure, and can handle large numbers of users during peak registration times. They also manage backend systems that communicate with databases to retrieve student records, course availability, and schedules.

Key Action: Ensuring the stability and functionality of the online registration system, troubleshooting technical issues, and handling system outages or login problems.

**6. Payment/Financial Aid Office**

Unique Process: This office handles the financial aspects of registration, including processing tuition payments, administering scholarships, and ensuring that financial aid packages are in place. They may place holds on student accounts for outstanding fees, preventing registration until the issue is resolved.

Key Action: Managing tuition payments, financial aid disbursement, and processing fee-related holds on accounts.

**7. Course Teaching Assistants (TAs)**

Unique Process: TAs might not be directly involved in registration, but they play a supporting role in managing the logistics of larger courses. They may be involved in helping the faculty prepare course materials, grading assignments, or providing office hours. TAs often communicate with students about the practical aspects of the course, including any adjustments to the schedule or course content.

Key Action: Assisting in course management, answering student queries, and providing support during the course.

**8. Peer Mentors**

Unique Process: Peer mentors, especially in larger universities, may assist new students with understanding how the registration system works. They help explain prerequisites, how to navigate the portal, and share tips on selecting courses that align with academic and career goals. They may also share advice on managing workload and registering for classes before they fill up.

Key Action: Guiding new students through the registration process and providing advice on course selection.

**9. Course/Program Coordinators**

Unique Process: Course coordinators ensure that courses are organized and ready for the semester. They liaise with instructors, TAs, and the registrar to ensure that course materials, schedules, and room assignments are properly arranged. They may also be responsible for adjusting enrollment numbers or course content based on demand or feedback.

Key Action: Coordinating course logistics, managing room assignments, and adjusting enrollment limits.

**10. Students’ Families (Optional)**

Unique Process: In some cases, especially for undergraduates, parents or guardians may be involved in the registration process, particularly if the student is financially dependent. They may assist in managing tuition payments, applying for financial aid, or even advising on course selection.

Key Action: Helping to pay for courses, offering financial or emotional support, and sometimes providing input on course decisions.

**11. System Administrators (University-Level)**

Unique Process: These individuals manage the overall architecture of the registration system at the university level. They oversee the databases that store student records, course catalogs, and registration timelines. They also manage the integration of different software tools, ensuring that the registration system functions well with other university systems (e.g., learning management systems).

Key Action: Administering and securing the backend systems that facilitate the registration process, including user access, data integrity, and integration with other university systems.

### 4. From Data to Actionable Information: You use a fitness tracker (or health app). What is one type of raw data it collects, and how does the system transform it into actionable information that makes you change your behavior?
**Raw Data: Steps Taken**
- The fitness tracker uses sensors (like an accelerometer or GPS) to measure your movements and count the number of steps you take.
- The raw data here is the number of steps logged throughout the day, typically in real-time, but it may also include information about the time of day or location of activity.
- Transformation into Actionable Information:

**Aggregating Data:**
- The system aggregates this raw data over time, often breaking it down into daily, weekly, or monthly reports.

**Setting Goals:**
- Based on your previous activity levels or preset goals (like a "10,000 steps per day" target), the app compares your current step count to your target. If you haven’t hit your goal, the system might alert you with a reminder, such as "You need 2,000 more steps to reach your daily goal."

**Feedback & Progress Tracking:**
- The app may provide a visual display (like a progress bar or chart) showing your step count over the course of the day or week. This visual cue helps to reinforce positive behavior if you're on track, or act as a motivator if you’re falling behind.

**Personalized Recommendations:**
- If the app detects patterns (e.g., you tend to walk more on weekends), it might suggest changes to your routine, such as “Try taking a 10-minute walk after lunch” to help you reach your daily goal.
- It might even suggest challenges like walking a certain number of steps each week or competing with friends.

**Actionable Information that Drives Behavior Change:**
- Goal Setting: Seeing that you’ve fallen short of your daily steps target can trigger a behavior change, motivating you to take extra steps before the day ends (like walking around the block after dinner).
- Instant Feedback: Real-time notifications when you reach milestones or when you're close to your goal can prompt you to keep going, even if you weren’t thinking about it.
- Long-term Progress: Regularly seeing your progress on a graph or chart showing step trends over time can provide a sense of achievement and drive you to keep up or improve your activity levels.
- Increased Awareness: The raw data (steps) being turned into actionable information helps you become more conscious of your daily activity. When you notice how much or how little you're moving, it may inspire you to make healthier decisions.

### 5. Failure of Integration: Describe a time when two systems (e.g., your university email and the course system) failed to work together smoothly. Was this a failure of data, software, or process integration? Explain briefly.
**Example:** Failure of Integration Between University Email and Course Management System
**Situation:**
At the start of a semester, I was enrolled in a course through the university’s course management system (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, etc.), but I wasn't receiving any emails or announcements from the university email system (e.g., Outlook) related to that class.
As a result, I missed important updates — including a schedule change and an assignment deadline — because those announcements were posted in the course system but never reached my email inbox.

### 6. The Process of Creating "Information": When you write a weekly summary for a class project, you are acting as an Information System. Which step in your process (e.g., filtering, synthesizing, summarizing) is the most critical for turning data into quality information?
**Why Synthesizing Matters Most:**
Data from the week may come in many forms: meeting notes, task updates, group messages, individual contributions, deadlines, etc.

Simply filtering or summarizing this raw data might present what happened, but it doesn't yet connect the dots or reveal what it all means.

Synthesizing is where you analyze the filtered data and pull together key points, patterns, relationships, or insights that make the information useful and actionable.

**Example:**
Raw data:
- Alice completed the research draft.
- Bob missed two meetings.
- The deadline was moved up.
- The team discussed restructuring the presentation.

**Synthesized information:**
- "While progress continues on the research draft, the team needs to address attendance issues and reassign tasks due to Bob’s absence. Additionally, the earlier deadline requires us to move the presentation prep to this week."

### 7. Hardware's Invisible Role: Beyond your personal computer, where does the crucial hardware for a large-scale system like LINE or WeChat actually reside? Name one type of hidden hardware and its function.
**One Type of Hidden Hardware:**
*Server (Application Server)*
**Function:**
- Application servers are powerful machines that host the core functions of the app — like messaging, file sharing, voice calls, and user authentication.
- Every time you send a message, upload a photo, or start a video call, the request is processed by these servers in real time.
- They manage millions of concurrent users, handle message delivery, and store temporary data like chat history and media.

**Why It’s “Invisible”:**
- You never see or directly interact with these servers — they’re located in secure, climate-controlled data centers around the world.
- But without them, the app wouldn’t function. Your phone is just the access point; the actual work is done on these back-end machines.
- 
### 8. Software as the 'Logic': Imagine a simple elevator system. The software is the logic. If the elevator ignores a call because it's full, which part of the IS definition is the software enforcing? (Hint: Think about rules).
💡**Explanation:**
- In an elevator system, there are rules that determine how the elevator behaves under different conditions.

**One rule might be:**
- “If the elevator reaches maximum capacity, do not accept new pickup requests until someone exits.”

The software checks the elevator’s current state (e.g., number of passengers or weight) and applies this logic to ignore or delay new requests.

🧠**In IS terms:**
- The software acts as the logic layer that enforces predefined rules and processes.
- It transforms raw input (button press on a floor) and system state (elevator is full) into a decision: do nothing, because the request can't be fulfilled safely or efficiently.

### 9. Identifying a True Information System: Is a simple spreadsheet (like a Google Sheet) used to track inventory a complete Information System? Using the full definition (H/S/D/P/P), what is it missing or what component is the weakest?
✅ **What it does include:**
- Hardware (H):
Your computer, tablet, or phone used to access the spreadsheet.

- Software (S):
Google Sheets (cloud-based spreadsheet application).

- Data (D):
The inventory items, quantities, dates, etc., stored in the sheet.

⚠️ **Weakest or Missing Components:**
- People (P):
There may be a person entering and updating the data manually — so technically present.

However, in many cases, this is just one user without structured roles or collaboration, which limits the system's effectiveness.

- Processes (P):
This is often the weakest component in a simple spreadsheet.

A true IS has defined rules, workflows, and automation — e.g., how to reorder stock, send alerts when inventory is low, or generate reports.

In a basic spreadsheet, there’s usually no automation, no validation rules, and no structured decision-making process.

🔍 **Conclusion:**
A simple Google Sheet lacks strong processes and structured people involvement, making it an incomplete or very limited Information System.

- To become a true IS, it would need:
Defined processes for data entry, decision-making, and action.

Multiple roles or users interacting based on clear responsibilities.

Possibly integration with other tools (e.g., email alerts, inventory systems) to support decisions.

### 10. The Purpose of IS in Your Career: Based on the IS purpose (support decision-making, communication, operations), which of these three goals will be the most valuable to your future job in Information Management? Why?

✅**Most Valuable IS Purpose for a Career in Information Management:**
→ Support Decision-Making

💡**Why?**
In a career in Information Management, your main responsibility will often be to turn raw data into insights that help organizations make smarter, faster, and more informed decisions.

Here’s how that aligns with the "support decision-making" goal:

🔍 **1. Turning Data into Strategy**
You’ll be collecting, organizing, and analyzing information from different sources.

Your insights will help leadership or departments decide what to prioritize, where to invest, or how to improve operations.

Example: Using customer data to recommend marketing strategies or analyzing system usage to improve software deployment.

🔍 **2. Providing the Right Info at the Right Time**
Decision-makers rely on timely, accurate, and relevant information.

Your job will include designing systems and dashboards that deliver exactly that, cutting through noise and highlighting what matters.

🔍 **3. Driving Business Value**
Good decisions lead to cost savings, increased efficiency, and better service — all of which are tied to how well information is managed.

Supporting decisions through IS means your work directly contributes to business success and competitive advantage.

✔ **Summary:**
In Information Management, your role isn’t just to manage data — it's to equip others to make smart decisions.
That makes “supporting decision-making” the most valuable IS goal in your future career.

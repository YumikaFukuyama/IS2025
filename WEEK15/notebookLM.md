## [History]: "Summarize the 'Mainframe Era' vs. 'PC Revolution' vs. 'Cloud Era' from the text. What changed in terms of accessibility?" ⏳

**The Mainframe Era (Late 1950s – 1960s)**

During this period, computers were "room-sized monsters" primarily used by large businesses, universities, and government agencies. Their main role was "data processing," such as performing complex calculations and organizing large volumes of information that were too tedious to manage by hand.

• Hardware: Terminals connected to a central mainframe computer.
• Accessibility: Very low. Computing was restricted to elite institutions because the systems required specialized personnel and dedicated facilities to operate.

**The PC Revolution (Mid-1970s – 1980s)**

The arrival of the microcomputer, starting with the Altair 8800 and later the Apple II and IBM PC, shifted the center of technology to Silicon Valley. This era saw the rise of the "Killer App" (the spreadsheet), which made computers essential for business.

• Hardware: Standalone personal computers.
• Accessibility: High. For the first time, small businesses and individuals had access to affordable, powerful computing tools that did not require a room-sized setup.

**The Cloud Era (Mid-2000s – Present)**

Often referred to as the "Post-PC World," this era is defined by the transition from local hardware to Internet-based services. Cloud computing allows users to access applications and data storage via the Internet rather than relying on a specific physical device.

• Hardware: Laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
• Accessibility: Ubiquitous. Information is now available from any computer or mobile device with an Internet connection. Users are no longer limited by their local memory or disk space.

**Summary: What Changed in Accessibility?**

The most significant change was the democratization of technology. Accessibility moved from Institutional (only for experts in large organizations) to Individual (standalone power for everyone) and finally to Ubiquitous (always-connected mobility). In the Mainframe Era, you had to go to the computer; in the PC era, the computer sat on your desk; in the Cloud Era, the computer is in your pocket and follows you everywhere.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Foundations (Unit 1.1 - 1.2) - 暖身區 🏃
#### [History]: "Summarize the 'Mainframe Era' vs. 'PC Revolution' vs. 'Cloud Era' from the text. What changed in terms of accessibility?" ⏳

**The Mainframe Era (Late 1950s – 1960s)**

During this period, computers were "room-sized monsters" primarily used by large businesses, universities, and government agencies. Their main role was "data processing," such as performing complex calculations and organizing large volumes of information that were too tedious to manage by hand.

• Hardware: Terminals connected to a central mainframe computer.
• Accessibility: Very low. Computing was restricted to elite institutions because the systems required specialized personnel and dedicated facilities to operate.

**The PC Revolution (Mid-1970s – 1980s)**

The arrival of the microcomputer, starting with the Altair 8800 and later the Apple II and IBM PC, shifted the center of technology to Silicon Valley. This era saw the rise of the "Killer App" (the spreadsheet), which made computers essential for business.

• Hardware: Standalone personal computers.
• Accessibility: High. For the first time, small businesses and individuals had access to affordable, powerful computing tools that did not require a room-sized setup.

**The Cloud Era (Mid-2000s – Present)**

Often referred to as the "Post-PC World," this era is defined by the transition from local hardware to Internet-based services. Cloud computing allows users to access applications and data storage via the Internet rather than relying on a specific physical device.

• Hardware: Laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
• Accessibility: Ubiquitous. Information is now available from any computer or mobile device with an Internet connection. Users are no longer limited by their local memory or disk space.

**Summary: What Changed in Accessibility?**

The most significant change was the democratization of technology. Accessibility moved from Institutional (only for experts in large organizations) to Individual (standalone power for everyone) and finally to Ubiquitous (always-connected mobility). In the Mainframe Era, you had to go to the computer; in the PC era, the computer sat on your desk; in the Cloud Era, the computer is in your pocket and follows you everywhere.

#### [Strategy]: "Explain Nicholas Carr's argument 'IT Doesn't Matter' (Chapter 7). Do the authors agree or disagree? Answer in Traditional Chinese." 📉

In Chapter 7, published by Nicholas Carr in 2003, ``IT Doesn't Matter'' The Great Conflict. Below are the other core points:

• IT Commodity: Carr recognizes the technology and the technology is Ubiquitous, like electricity or water supply. When one kind of technology changes and everyone is available, it is the elemental effect of the differentiating factors that give rise to competitive advantages.

• Change in management focus: IT is a product, Carr proposes an enterprise that does not see its ability to invest in the territory, and the image management is public works, focus on lowering the number of books, ensuring fixed operation and minimizing style.

**Do you agree with the author? Author Carr's attitude towards viewing:**
1. Approved by the author Carr's article was published at the important discussion of IT business strategy and status.
2. However, the author's transparent example of Walmart refuted Carr, and the explanation of Walmart's transparent information system was high priority, and success was achieved and continued competitive advantage.
3. Author's citation completed 2008 research conclusion, recognized that IT has the ability to be intelligent and strategic in the department, parallel and deep integration of business processes, ensure the ability to strengthen the differences between companies and the advantages of the future.

#### [People]: "List 5 key IT job roles (e.g., CIO, Systems Analyst) mentioned in Chapter 9 and their main responsibilities. Which one fits a 'creative' person best?" 🧑‍💻

**Based on Chapter 9, here are five essential roles within information systems:**

**1. Systems Analyst:** This individual bridges the gap between identifying business needs and imagining a new or redesigned system to fulfill those needs. They work with stakeholders to document requirements and translate them into a design for developers.

**2. Programmer/Developer:** Their primary task is writing computer code using various programming languages. They take the design specifications provided by systems analysts and build the actual software.

**3. Database Administrator (DBA):** This person is responsible for designing and managing the databases of an organization. They ensure data is accessible, organized, and consult on projects requiring data warehouse integration.

**4. Chief Information Officer (CIO):** The head of the IS function who aligns IT operations with the organization's strategic goals. Their role focuses more on management, budgeting, and personnel than on technical tasks.

**5. Project Manager:** They are responsible for keeping IT projects on time and on budget. They coordinate schedules and resources, serving as a communicator between the team and management.

Which one fits a "creative" person best? The Systems Analyst fits a creative person best. According to the textbook, this role requires an individual to "imagine" new systems. Because they must find unique ways to solve business problems and design how users will interface with new technology, it requires a high degree of creative problem-solving and visualization. Alternatively, a Computer Engineer (specifically hardware or software design) also suits creative types as they are often at the "cutting edge," creating "something brand new".

## 🟡 Phase 2: Technology Core (Unit 3 - 5, Select top 5 topics) - 技術核心 ⚙️
#### **[Hardware]**: "Explain **Moore's Law** simply. Is it still valid today according to the text? Use a metaphor of a car or a building." 🏎️

Moore’s Law was an observation by Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years. This has been generalized to mean that computing power doubles every two years for the same price point. According to the sources, this law is no longer able to be maintained because the physical limits of reducing circuits further are being reached.

**Metaphor:** If a car followed Moore’s Law, its engine power would double every two years while its price stayed the same; eventually, it would become incredibly fast for the price of a basic model.

#### **[Binary]**: "How does the text explain **Bit vs. Byte**? Give me a calculation example of file size." 0️⃣1️⃣

A bit is the smallest unit of data, representing a "1" or a "0". A byte is a group of eight bits. To represent a number like 15 in binary, you need four bits (1111), but to send it as a full byte, the computer sends "00001111".

**Calculation**: File sizes are measured in multiples of 1,000; for example, a kilobyte (KB) is one thousand bytes, and a megabyte (MB) is one million bytes.
    
#### **[Software]**: "What is the difference between **Operating Systems** and **Application Software**? Give 3 examples of each from the book." 💿

The Operating System (OS) manages hardware resources and provides the interface for both users and applications. Application software allows users to perform specific tasks.

**OS Examples: Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu Linux, and Apple iOS.**
**Application Examples: Microsoft Excel, Google Chrome, and iTunes.**

#### **[Open Source]**: "What are the pros and cons of **Open Source Software** (e.g., Linux)? Why would a company choose it over Windows?" 🐧

Open-source software makes its source code available for anyone to copy and use.

**Pros**: It allows thousands of programmers to collaborate, which can lead to faster innovation and security patches.
**Cons**: Some businesses worry that making the code visible increases the risk of attacks.
**Choice**: A company might choose Linux over Windows to avoid restrictive licensing fees or to customize the code to their specific needs.
    
#### **[Data Hierarchy]**: "Explain the DIKW pyramid (**Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom**) using the example of 'Student Grades' found in Chapter 4." 🔺

The text uses student data to explain the Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom hierarchy:

**Data**: Raw facts like a "Student ID 1234" or "Grade A".
**Information**: Data with context, such as calculating a student's GPA.
**Knowledge**: Understanding relationships, such as realizing that students with high attendance usually get better grades.
**Wisdom**: Using knowledge and experience to make deeper decisions, such as improving a curriculum to boost student success

#### **[Database]**: "What is a **Relational Database**? Explain 'Primary Key' and 'Foreign Key' using the 'Student-Class' example." 🔑

A relational database organizes data into tables consisting of rows (records) and columns (fields).

**Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record, such as a Student ID.
**Foreign Key:** A field in one table that links to the primary key of another table, such as putting a Student ID in a GRADE table to link a specific grade to a specific student.

#### **[Big Data]**: "Summarize the section on **Big Data** and **Data Mining**. How does Walmart use it for competitive advantage?" 🛒

Big Data refers to datasets so massive that traditional tools cannot analyze them. Data Mining is the automated process of finding patterns in these datasets. Walmart uses these technologies to manage its supply chain; by sharing real-time inventory data with suppliers, it allows them to manage their own stock levels, giving Walmart a competitive advantage in pricing.
    
#### **[Networking]**: "Explain the difference between **LAN, WAN, and Intranet**. Use emojis to visualize the scope." 🌐

**LAN (Local Area Network):** Operates in a small area, like a single building or campus. 🏢
**WAN (Wide Area Network):** Connects locations across cities, states, or even countries. 🌍
**Intrane A private set of web resources accessible only to an organization’s employees. 🔒**    
  
#### **[Internet History]**: "Who invented the **World Wide Web** vs. the **Internet**? What is the difference according to the text?" 🕸️

The Internet was created in 1969 via the ARPANET project by the U.S. Department of Defense. The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented later, in 1989, by Tim Berners-Lee. The sources explain that the Internet is the "network of networks" (the global infrastructure), while the WWW is just one service that runs across it using HTML pages and browsers.
    
#### **[Wireless]**: "Compare **3G, 4G, and 5G** speeds based on the table in Chapter 13. What new applications does 5G enable?" 📶

**Speeds:** 3G reached ~2 Mbps, 4G reached ~200 Mbps, and 5G is expected to exceed 1 Gbps.
**Applications:** 5G's high speed and low latency will accelerate an "always-connected" world and may lead some households to replace wired home Internet with 5G wireless connections.

## 🔴 Phase 3: Systems in Action (Unit 6 - 7, Select top 5 topics) - 應用與流程 🔄 (”All-In”)
<img width="2752" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/276b89f9-c3f2-40c3-bf6b-190196cb95cf" />

#### **[ERP]**: "What is an **ERP system**? Why is 'Centralized Database' critical for ERP? Use the 'Lego' metaphor." 🧱
An ERP system is a software application with a centralized database used to manage an entire organization's business. It includes modules for different functions such as finance, manufacturing, inventory, and human resources.

• Why a Centralized Database is Critical: Without a centralized source, different departments (like sales and finance) often create their own separate databases, leading to conflicting data and "silos" of information. A centralized database ensures that every user edits and saves information to the same data source, enforcing consistency across the enterprise.

• The Lego Metaphor: Think of an ERP system as a Lego baseplate. The centralized database is the baseplate that everything snaps into. Each business function (Accounting, HR, Sales) is a Lego brick (module). Because they are designed to fit the same baseplate, they connect perfectly to each other, creating one solid, integrated structure instead of a pile of scattered, incompatible pieces.

#### **[Supply Chain]**: "Explain **SCM (Supply Chain Management)** using the 'Walmart Retail Link' case study in the text." 🚚
SCM manages the linkage between an organization’s suppliers, manufacturing facilities, and product distributors. The sources highlight Walmart’s Retail Link system as a primary example of using SCM for a competitive advantage.

• The Walmart Case: Implemented in the mid-1980s, Retail Link allows Walmart's thousands of suppliers to directly access real-time inventory levels and sales information for their products at any store.

• Strategy: Walmart requires suppliers to use this data to manage their own stock levels. This effectively allows Walmart to "hire" thousands of product managers (the suppliers) who have a vested interest in ensuring their products are available, which reduces costs and allows Walmart to respond to market forces with high speed.

#### **[Programming]**: "What is the difference between **Compiled** and **Interpreted** programming languages? Which one is Java?" ☕
Programming is the process of creating logical instructions for a computer using a specific language.

• Compiled Languages: The developer writes source code, which is then translated by a compiler into a machine-readable executable form before the program can be run. These are generally faster and more efficient. Examples: C, C++.

• Interpreted Languages: These require a runtime program to be installed; the code is translated line-by-line every time the user runs it. Examples: Python, BASIC.

• Java: This is a hybrid. It is partially compiled to create a program for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Because each operating system has its own JVM, a single Java program can run on many different types of hardware.

#### **[SDLC]**: "List the stages of **SDLC (Waterfall)**. Why is it considered 'rigid' compared to **Agile**?" 🌊

The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for managing large software projects.

• Stages of SDLC: 
1. Preliminary Analysis
2. System Analysis
3. System Design
4. Programming
5. Testing
6. Implementation
7. Maintenance.

• Why it is "Rigid": Often called the Waterfall methodology, it requires each step to be completed before the next can begin. It is not amenable to changes; once the process starts, requirements cannot be altered, and no software is available for viewing until the very end.

• Agile: In contrast, Agile uses incremental changes and frequent iterations. It focuses on small, cross-functional teams and daily reviews, allowing for flexibility and constant user feedback.

#### **[Mobile Dev]**: "What are the challenges of building **Mobile Apps** vs. Desktop Apps? (Focus on battery and screen size)." 📱

#### **[Cloud]**: "Explain **Cloud Computing** (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). What are the benefits for a startup company?" ☁️

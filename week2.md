# ðŸ’¡Unit 1.2 What Is an Information System (IS)? W2
## A. Your Kickstart Mission
### 1. Data vs. Information in Your Bank App: When you check your banking app, you see your current balance. What is the raw data that had to be collected and processed to generate that single piece of information (your balance)?
**Deposits:**
Raw data includes the amount and source of deposits (e.g., direct deposit, checks, wire transfers).

Date and time of the deposit.

Account details such as the senderâ€™s account number and the receiverâ€™s account number.

**Withdrawals:**
Raw data for any withdrawals includes the amount, merchant or ATM name, and the location (if applicable).

Date and time of the withdrawal.

The method used for withdrawal (e.g., debit card, ACH, wire).

**Transfers:**
For any transfers between accounts, raw data includes transfer amount, sending account, receiving account, and the transaction date.

**Pending Transactions:**
Data on any transactions that have been authorized but are not yet finalized, including pending charges on the account (e.g., a hotel hold or an authorized but unprocessed payment).

**Interest or Fees:**
Raw data from the bankâ€™s algorithms determining your interest rate or fees, including any monthly maintenance fees, overdraft charges, or interest payments on your account.

**Transaction History:**
A list of past transactions (including deposits, withdrawals, fees, and interest) that are used to compute the current balance.

Data on transaction status (approved, pending, etc.).

**Bankâ€™s Data Systems:**
The bankâ€™s internal processing system stores transaction logs, account states, and historical balance information, which all contribute to calculating the final balance.

**Process:**
1. The bank collects all the transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).

2. It filters out pending or unprocessed transactions.

3. It applies any fees, interest calculations, or adjustments.

4. The system aggregates the total of all processed transactions to produce your current balance.

### 2. The 'System' of Online Shopping: Describe your process for buying a textbook online (from search to checkout). Identify one piece of hardware and one piece of software that is essential for this system to function.
**Step 1:** You visit an online bookstore or marketplace (e.g., Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or a specialized textbook site like Chegg).

**Step 2:** You use the websiteâ€™s search function to look for the textbook by entering the title, author, ISBN, or course code.

**Step 3:** The site presents a list of textbooks that match or closely match your search query, including various editions, formats (hardcover, paperback, eBook), and prices.

**Step 4:** You review the search results and click on the textbook you want to buy.

**Step 5:** You check the book's details, such as edition, condition (new or used), price, shipping options, and availability. You may also check if there are any discounts or additional services like rental options or digital access.

**Step 6:** After confirming the details, you click the "Add to Cart" button. The system updates your virtual shopping cart to reflect the selected textbook.

**Step 7:** You navigate to your shopping cart to review the items youâ€™ve selected. You can change quantities, remove items, or apply any available promo codes.

**Step 8:** Once satisfied with the items in your cart, you click the "Proceed to Checkout" button.

**Step 9:** You are prompted to enter your shipping address, payment details (credit card, PayPal, etc.), and possibly a billing address.

**Step 10:** Some sites may offer login options to save your information for future purchases, or you may be a guest buyer.

**Step 11:** You review all your details one last time, including the bookâ€™s price, shipping costs, and estimated delivery date.

**Step 12:** You confirm the purchase, and the system processes the payment.

**Step 13:** You receive an order confirmation screen and/or email with details of your order, estimated delivery, and tracking information.

### 3. 'People' as IS Components: Think about your experience with university registration. Who are the different "People" involved in that system (not just you), and what unique process does each person enable?
